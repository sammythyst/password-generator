# Password Generator
Module 3 Challenge - JavaScript

## Description
The purpose of this project is to allow users to create uniquely generated passwords for whatever they may need a password for. This password generator allows users to customize their passwords in the sense of allowing custom length as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and select special characters.

## Usage
To start, click the "Generate Password" button on screen. You'll be given a prompt asking how long you want your password to be, to continue, input a numeral between 8 and 128 to select character length. Then the prompt will ask if you want your password to contain lowercase letters, click "OK" for yes or "Cancel" for no (this will also be the answering format for the remainder of the prompts). The prompts following will ask if you want uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, include each at your desire. After answering the prompt about the special characters, the prompt boxes will disappear and your new password will be generated in the box on screen.
